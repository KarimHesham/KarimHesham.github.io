                  The Star Wars Saga Is Back
                </h2>
                <p class="article-content">
                  Like a tremor in the Force, the division stirred by "The Last Jedi" created friction in the "Star Wars" universe. That left director J.J. Abrams with additional clean-up work to do on "The Rise of Skywalker," a "Star Wars" movie made very much with devout fans in mind, and one that proves highly satisfying as an end not just to this trilogy, but a saga 42 years in the making.
                  Abrams (who co-wrote the script with "Justice League" scribe Chris Terrio) also directed "The Force Awakens," and in hindsight, Lucasfilm would have been wise -- or at least saved itself some headaches -- not to entrust its baby (one even more precious than the child in "The Mandalorian") to multiple artistic visions. Love or hate "Last Jedi," it went off in directions that seemed to depart from the groundwork that Abrams and company had laid out.

                      Chance The Rapper Cancels Tour In Sake Of Family Time
                    </h2>
                    <p class="article-content">
                      Chance the Rapper has canceled his national tour, the Big Tour, which was scheduled to kick off in January.
The performer announced the decision in an Instagram post on Sunday, apologizing to fans and explaining that he is taking the time to be with family, create new music and develop "my best show to date."
"I know it sucks and it's been a lot of back and forth with reschedules and rerouting, but it's for the best," he said in the post.
It's not the first time the artist has made big tour announcements on social media.
Chance took to Instagram in September to tell fans he was postponing the tour -- which was slated to begin that month -- until the following year.

                          Juice WRLD Dies Aged 21
                        </h2>
                        <p class="article-content">
                          Rapper and singer Juice WRLD has died in Chicago, the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office said Sunday.
                          Juice, who was born Jarad Anthony Higgins, turned 21 on December 2.
                          The rapper suffered a medical emergency shortly after arriving at Chicago's Midway International Airport, according to people who were traveling with him, Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in an email to CNN. The rapper died shortly after at a nearby hospital, according to police.
                          "There were no signs of foul play and all individuals aboard the aircraft are cooperating with CPD and have given all of their information," Guglielmi said.
                          Police are waiting for the medical examiner to determine cause and manner of death, he said.
