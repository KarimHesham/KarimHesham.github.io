        Chance the Rapper has canceled his national tour, the Big Tour, which
        was scheduled to kick off in January. The performer announced the
        decision in an Instagram post on Sunday, apologizing to fans and
        explaining that he is taking the time to be with family, create new
        music and develop "my best show to date." "I know it sucks and it's been
        a lot of back and forth with reschedules and rerouting, but it's for the
        best," he said in the post. It's not the first time the artist has made
        big tour announcements on social media. Chance took to Instagram in
        September to tell fans he was postponing the tour -- which was slated to
        begin that month -- until the following year. His reason then remains
        the same as it is now: The artist wants to spend time with his growing
        family. Chance apologized to his fans, who continue to show up for his
        shows, but also to those who were planning on attending their first
        Chance concert during the Big Tour. "I'm deeply sorry to anyone with a
        ticket who has supported me this past decade by coming to a show and
        rocking out with me and I feel even worse for anyone who was planning on
        making this their first Chance concert," he said. Chance and his wife,
        Kirsten Bennett, have two young daughters, but the rapper sometimes
        finds himself torn away from the family by his career. "When Kensli was
        born, I went on tour 2 weeks later and missed some of the most important
        milestones in her life, but more importantly I was absent when her
        mother needed me the most. At this point as a husband and father of two
        I realize that I can't make that mistake again," he wrote in his
        September tour delay announcement. Those who commented on the post are
        widely disappointed, but expressed their support for the artists'
        decision. "Take all the time you need Chance, we'll still he here,"
        commented one fan, followed by a heart emoji. "Sometimes you gotta step
        away from something good to achieve something better," another comment
        says. "Was looking forward to seeing you for the first time on stage,
        but will keep an eye out for the next time you hit up Montreal. All
        love." Chance promises he'll be back soon, though. Just look out for him
        sometime next year. "I promise to come back much stronger and better in
        2020 and hope to see some of you guys there. I truly love you and God
        bless."
