      <article style="color: black">
        Aston Martin Red Bull Racing’s Max Verstappen started the Brazilian
        Grand Prix at the front of the grid after claiming his second career
        pole position by 0.123s from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. He drove a
        masterful race, surviving a pit-lane near miss and two safety-car
        periods to win his eighth Grand Prix and third of 2019. At the chequered
        flag, the Dutch driver wasn't joined on the podium by rookie team-mate
        Alex Albon, who was only one lap away from his maiden Formula One
        podium, but instead was joined by Scuderia Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly,
        who claimed his first podium finish in dramatic fashion. The race Max
        Verstappen made a perfect start from pole position. Behind him, Lewis
        Hamilton beat Sebastian Vettel into the first left-hand corner to take
        second place, as Alex Albon survived the opening lap to maintain his
        qualifying position of fifth. By Lap 5, Verstappen's lead over Hamilton
        amounted to almost 2.5s, showing the pace of the Honda power plant on
        the relatively short, anticlockwise Interlagos circuit. Albon,
        meanwhile, hassled the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas in the developing
        battle for fourth. On Lap 8, the Renault of Daniel Ricciardo made
        contact with Kevin Magnussen’s Haas under braking for the left-hand Turn
        3, sending the Danish driver into a spin and causing damage to the front
        wing of Ricciardo's car. Of the front runners, Hamilton was the first to
        stop, on Lap 20, followed by Verstappen one lap later. It very nearly
        all went wrong for the Dutch driver. Despite a rapid sub-two-second stop
        for Verstappen, the Williams of Robert Kubica was unsafely released in
        front of him, baulking Verstappen as he exited the pit lane and putting
        him behind Hamilton on track. For the second year in a row it looked as
        though the actions of another team could rob Verstappen the chance of a
        win in Brazil, but thankfully the pace of his Honda power plant allowed
        him to get back in front of Hamilton not once, but twice in quick
        succession. Despite some dramatic duelling between Verstappen and
        Hamilton, the Aston Martin Red Bull Racing man made light work of the
        Mercedes and by Lap 27 was back in the lead, with Hamilton in second, as
        Vettel and Bottas pitted. At the halfway mark, Verstappen's lead over
        Hamilton was a shade over three seconds. The reigning F1 champion was
        lamenting his tyre choice over the radio, feeling his soft tyres were
        not the way to go, and Vettel was showing good pace in third on the
        medium compound tyres. Hamilton made his second pit stop on Lap 43,
        followed by Verstappen one lap later, and another sub-two-second stop
        put Verstappen back ahead of Hamilton with a reduced advantage, but
        crucially having foiled Mercedes' attempt to undercut. With Vettel
        leading, Verstappen resumed the lead when the Ferrari driver pitted on
        Lap 49, keeping second-place driver Hamilton out of DRS range. The real
        action was the drive from Charles Leclerc in the Ferrari, as he fought
        hard to resist Bottas's challenge for fourth. Any hope of fourth place
        for Bottas was ended on Lap 52, when a few puffs of smoke signalled a
        terminal engine problem and the first retirement for the Finnish driver
        since the German Grand Prix in July. Crucially, Bottas's retirement led
        to the introduction of the safety car, neutralising the race and leading
        to Verstappen pitting for a third time to take soft tyres, as Hamilton
        stayed out. Verstappen rejoined the track in second and at the restart
        passed Hamilton with a stunning move on the outside of the Senna S, with
        team-mate Albon sneaking into third ahead of the two Ferraris in a
        brilliant move belying his relative lack of F1 experience. As Verstappen
        stretched out his lead over Hamilton, it was Albon's turn to shine and
        he set about pressuring the world champion for second place. With 10
        laps remaining he was within DRS range, but the Thai-British driver was
        in turn being caught by Vettel and was forced to brilliantly defend his
        podium place from the four-time champion.
