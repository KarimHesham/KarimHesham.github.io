        At least 12 demonstrators were killed and 22 others wounded Friday when
        gunmen in several vehicles opened fire on a protest site in central
        Baghdad, medical sources and activists told CNN, marking one of the most
        violent days in the Iraqi capital for weeks. As thousands of
        anti-government demonstrators rallied in Baghdad's Tahrir Square -- the
        epicenter of the protest movement -- the gunmen seized a nearby parking
        garage that is used by activists. The gunmen have not yet been
        identified. An ambulance arrives in Tahrir Square after gunmen opened
        fire on anti-government protesters. Hundreds of members of
        pro-government militias have descended on Tahrir Square in a show of
        force over recent days, raising fears over further unrest, several
        activists told CNN. During his weekly Friday sermon, Iraq's top Shiite
        cleric warned against meddling, saying that the country's new premier
        must be chosen "without any foreign interference." The clock is ticking
        for lawmakers to replace Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi, who announced
        his resignation last week, calling on Iraq's government to "preserve the
        blood of its people" and "avoid slipping into a cycle of violence, chaos
        and devastation." News of Abdul Mahdi's departure was greeted in
        Baghdad's Tahrir Square with fireworks. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani
        has previously condemned the killing of unarmed protesters, as well as
        the government's failure to handle the demonstrations, sparked over
        endemic corruption, high unemployment, inadequate public services and
        Iran's interference in the country. Protesters blame Iran for being
        complicit in the Iraqi government's failures, and now its crackdown.
        Al-Sistani's remarks came on the same day that the United States imposed
        sanctions on four Iraqis, including "three leaders of Iran-backed
        militias" over corruption and human rights abuses. According to a
        statement released by the Treasury Department, the militias were behind
        the killing of dozens of peaceful protesters. "Iraqis have played a step
        and bloody price" because of the Iranian regime's involvement in the
        country, assistant secretary of state David Schenker said. Schenker
        noted that Qassem Suleimani, leader of Iran's elite Quds Force, has
        recently been in Iraq in part "to determine the next political leader of
        Iraq." "It is not normal," Schenker said. "This is unorthodox ... a huge
        violation of Iraqi sovereignty." Some 432 people have been killed since
        anti-goverment demonstrations began in Iraq on October 1, according to a
        source with the Independent High Commission for Human Rights of Iraq.
        Another 19,136 people have been injured in the demonstrations, the
        Commission has said. Activists are calling for the government to step
        down and hold early elections under direct supervision of the United
        Nations, in response to the deadly crackdown.
