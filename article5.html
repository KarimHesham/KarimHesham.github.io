      <article style="color: black">
        James Harden made NBA history this week becoming the first player to
        record back-to-back 50-point games with more than 10 3-pointers made in
        each game. The Houston Rockets guard scored 55 points in the team's
        116-110 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers and 54 points in their
        130-107 win against the Orlando Magic, according to the Rockets website.
        When asked by reporters Friday how he felt about the accomplishment,
        Harden said: "I just want to win man, whatever it takes." It's not the
        first time Harden scored 50-plus points, though. He's done it five times
        so far this season and three times in December alone. Harden also joined
        Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry as the only players in NBA
        history to have back-to-back games with more than 10 3-pointers made.
        Rapper 50 Cent and Rockets luminary Dikembe Mutombo attended the recent
        game against the Sacramento Kings, although the atmosphere does not
        compare to the celebrity-heavy crowd at Los Angeles Lakers games. Still,
        Harden has inspired the Rockets’ fan base as he has made his way into
        the record books. So much so that he already ranks high among Rockets
        former stars, including Hakeem Olajuwon, who helped them to two
        consecutive NBA titles (1994, 1995). How does a seven-time All-Star and
        two-time league scoring champion improve each season amid increasingly
        swarming defenses? Harden answered that question as quickly as it takes
        to throw a defender off-balance or bait him into committing a foul. "It
        doesn’t just happen because it happens," Harden said. "I work every
        single day." Harden can make step-back 3-pointers, floaters or free
        throws at a consistent rate. As much as the Rockets have marveled at
        this for the past eight seasons, they believe Harden is just getting
        started. "This year, he is better again," general manager Daryl Morey
        told USA TODAY Sports. "It’s unprecedented in NBA history for a guy to
        get better like this." Harden has averaged a league-leading 39.3 points,
        marking the highest total by a player through the first 22 games of a
        season since Wilt Chamberlain in 1962-63. Harden became the first player
        in history to average at least 35 points and seven assists. And Harden
        recently tied Michael Jordan for third-most 60-point performances in
        history (four) behind Kobe Bryant (six) and Chamberlain (32). Harden led
        the NBA in scoring in each of the past two seasons (30.4 in 2017-18,
        36.1 in 2018-19); recorded the highest scoring average since Jordan’s
        37.1 points per game in 1986-87; and recorded career-highs in free-throw
        attempts per game for five consecutive seasons. This season, Harden
        appears likely to cement new career-highs in points and free-throw
        attempts per game. No wonder coach Mike D’Antoni considers Harden to be
        "one of the best offensive players ever." "He’s getting better every
        year and even more efficient," D’Antoni told USA TODAY Sports. "We can
        put him on the hardest player on the other team. He still plays his 40
        minutes and doesn’t get tired. I think he’s a lot better this year than
        last year."
