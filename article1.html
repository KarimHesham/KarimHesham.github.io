        At least 59 Jewish gravestones and monuments were vandalized in northern
        Slovakia, local police said, calling the crime "monstrous" and the
        resulting spiritual damage "incalculable." The tombstones were tipped
        over and broken up in the Jewish cemetery in Namestovo, near the Polish
        border, the leader of Slovakia's Jewish community said. Non-Jewish
        locals had been taking care of the cemetery for decades, since the local
        Jewish community was murdered in World War II, Richard Duda said in a
        statement. "The tombstones remained untouched for many decades and
        survived the Second World War, which took away those whose descendants
        would be caring for the graves of their loved ones today," Duda said.
        "The locals realized that relatives could no longer take care of the
        graves because they flew up the chimney," he said, in a reference to the
        ovens where Jews were burned in the Holocaust. "The Central Union of
        Jewish Religious Communities in Slovakia asks all decent citizens of
        Slovakia not to remain silent," he said. Karol Kurtilík, who heads the
        civic association Pamätaj (Remember), said he hoped the monuments would
        be restored quickly and that a new security systems would be installed
        at the cemetery. "So that this never happens again," he added in a post
        on the Pamätaj has been taking care of the cemetery for years, and
        Kurtilík said the unknown vandals had destroyed a near decade-long
        restoration work of the association. "Such [a] terrible act of vandalism
        is something that hasn't happen even during Second World War," he added.
        The World Jewish Congress lamented the attack, which was discovered on
        Monday, pointing out it was a relatively rare event in the country. "The
        Jews of Slovakia have in recent years been fortunately spared of overtly
        aggressive expressions of anti-Semitism, but it has become sadly clear
        that in the climate of xenophobia and hatred spiraling across Europe,
        every minority community is indeed a potential target for malicious
        attack," the WJC said in a statement. "We thank the local police
        authorities for treating this attack with the severity that it deserves
        and hope that the perpetrators will be located and brought to justice at
        once. This was an inexcusable and direct attack against the Jewish
        community, which must be condemned at the highest levels." Police said
        Tuesday they were opening a criminal investigation for the offense of
        desecration of final resting places.
